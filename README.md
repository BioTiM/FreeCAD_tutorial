# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to collect useful links and best practices we found during the developments for the Mater project. Therefore, it is not a general-purpose guide on how to use FreeCAD. We may classify the FreeCAD users into three groups. *End users* do every operation from the graphical user interface (GUI) of FreeCAD. *Power users* also make use of the Python interface to automate certain steps and to extend the capabilities of FreeCAD. Then we have the *developers*, who contribute to the FreeCAD source code and write the core functionalities in C++ and in Python. This tutorial targets power users. All you need to know is basic Python programming.
