# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to collect useful links and best practices we found during the developments for the Mater project. Therefore, it is not a general-purpose guide on how to use FreeCAD. We may classify the FreeCAD users into three groups. *End users* do every operation from the graphical user interface (GUI) of FreeCAD. *Power users* also make use of the Python interface to automate certain steps and to extend the capabilities of FreeCAD. Then we have the *developers*, who contribute to the FreeCAD source code and write the core functionalities in C++ and in Python. This tutorial targets power users. All you need to know is basic Python programming.



# How to read this manual

The main sections seen in the table of contents above are generally independent from each other, so you can use this manual as a reference (actually, this manual *is* more a reference than a step-by-step guide). However, we strongly suggest that you read the [**Installing FreeCAD**](#installing-freecad) section even if you already have FreeCAD installed. The reason is that power users need the proper version of FreeCAD to perform certain tasks. If you are a new user, you can greatly benefit from the [**Getting started**](#getting-started) section, which is meant to be a collection of advices to efficiently get started using FreeCAD.

The manual is rich in inline references, which are hyperlinks that bring you to the webpage where the information comes from. Apart from that, sections and subsections have some standalone references at the end, which let you further immerse in the topic.

If you notice typos, inaccurate or untrue information, or have questions or suggestions, please contact us (see section [**Contributing**](#contributing)) to improve this manual.
